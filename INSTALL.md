# How to Build in the Linux

Install required build dependecies:

- [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)

**Git clone the node-editor repo with submodule**

```
git clone https://github.com/scarsty/node-editor
cd node-editor
git submodule update --init 
```

**And you can use this to build this repo**

Please modify the **CMakeLists.txt**

About the IncludePath and link please make sure the yaml-cpp 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

```

**SDL2 install**

- `download the source from the offcial website:http://www.libsdl.org/`
